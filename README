See notes on configuring PulseAudio (Linux). This actually didn't get much mileage on Ubuntu.

Disabling audio input in the Juce plugin host, however, did mostly reduce glitching.

First and foremost, you'll need to implement a PluginProcessor and a PluginEditor.
Following that, you'll want to make a few small edits in /ThirdParty/Juce/BUILD. Write a Config target containing all of the project-specific macros that are required when building Juce.

That's all that is necessary to build. Remember to pass some command line flags when attempting to
build.

For example:
blaze build MyProject:Main --define="project=badcodec" --define="mode=plugin"

Without the last flag, you'll get an error about JucePlugin_Name being undefined.
